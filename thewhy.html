          <h1>Growing up</h1>

          So if the environmental preservation opportunity that cities offer is
          to be realised, then the citizens of the Anthropocene will need to
          live far more efficiently than most city dwellers currently do.<br /><br />

          Cities will need to incorporate the natural world in new and
          innovative ways. Parks and green spaces will be multiplied from ground
          level upwards, attracting birds and wildlife to sky-gardens, tens of
          floors up. In Singapore, for example, the Marina Bay Sands hotel
          features a skypark on the 56th floor, with trees, leisure facilities
          including a pool, and far-reaching views. It’s an example of how
          specific elements found in the natural world, such as a mountaintop
          view, a lake and palm trees, have been cherry picked and combined to
          provide an easy, entirely artificial landscape for the city.<br /><br />

          Vertical farms are also being planted in Anthropocene cities, although
          the energy involved in irrigating and maintaining such farms makes
          them impractical for food production on a larger scale. However,
          growing food in the urban environment on regular multi-storey plots is
          likely to increase as hobby farmers, beekeepers and specialist growers
          take advantage of cleaner air, water and soils of Anthropocene cities,
          and vacant sites are used more effectively. In Berlin, rooftop
          fishfarms have been started, with the waste going to feed agricultural
          plots in the city. Creative growers are already converting industrial
          spaces, street corners and rooftops to micro-wildernesses or manicured
          into formal gardens. A disused raised railway in New York City has
          become a popular park, self-styled “guerilla gardeners” are planting
          flowers and trees in plots among the tarmac and traffic of London’s
          highways, and once-polluted industrial wastelands now chirp with
          birdsong, rivers swim with fish and populations of animals that have
          become rare in the countryside are thriving in urban niches.<br /><br />

          There is already a new field of urban ecology for scientists who study
          the city and biophysical interactions within it, in a similar way to
          traditional ecosystem research. In fact, a surprising amount of
          wildlife now depends on the human-made environment, from the clouds of
          huge Sydney fruit bats to London’s wily foxes, to skyscraper-nesting
          peregrine falcons, animals have made cities their home - in some
          cases, their natural habitats have disappeared. In other places, the
          mix of human-introduced plant and animal species, and those
          opportunists that migrate to the urban environment, are interacting to
          produce unique ecosystems that exist nowhere else. Seagulls, for
          example, now often live in cities hundreds of kilometres from the
          coast. As their traditional food – fish – becomes scarcer, they
          scavenge human rubbish.<br /><br />

          Whether traditional conservationists and wildlife lovers learn to
          value these new flourishings that are occurring at such a rapid rate
          is still to be seen. But what is certain is that the survivors of
          these menagerie experiments in the human garden will produce a genetic
          legacy. In centuries to come, new species that could not have formed
          under pressure from any natural circumstances will be testimony to our
          mixing. Already, urban moths have evolved changes in shade suiting
          their dull concrete habitat (compared with the tree trunks they used
          to live among), songbirds have got louder to compete with traffic
          noise. And, as many city dwellers know, there are now new varieties of
          urban rat, housemouse and cockroach.
