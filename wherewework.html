            <p>
              Over 4 billion people around the world live in urban areas today.
              By 2050 that number will be well over 6 billion, twice as many as
              who will be living in a rural setting and a complete reversal of
              the situation that existed in the 1950s. In one hundred short
              years, humanity will have changed from being two thirds rural to
              two thirds urban.<br /><br />
              In many ways this is great â€“ towns and cities have historically
              been engines for growth, prosperity and improvements in living
              standards. But they can also be tough places to live too. People
              can become socially isolated and yet live at high densities,
              creating mental health issues.

          We need to completely reimagine what a town or a city is, and what it
          means to be a town or city dweller.<br /><br />
          As humanity moves into the urban world of the future, we face one of
          the most critical challenges of our generation: how do we make the
          make the best of this opportunity and avoid the worst of the risks? My
          answer is that we need to completely reimagine what a town or a city
          is, and what it means to be a town or city dweller. One part of the
          solution is to bring nature back into our towns and cities, connecting
          people back to nature and embracing decisions that will create<br />
          a new era of natural cities.
