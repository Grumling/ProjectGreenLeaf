<h1>Urban areas could be the best hope for the survival of many species.</h1>
here is an optimistic view of the unprecedented migration we are witnessing from rural to urban areas, 
and it’s that cities could offer the biggest hope for the survival of other species and ecosystems in 
the Anthropocene. Cities are entirely shaped and created by humans to protect and separate them from 
the natural world, allowing selected bits in and banishing others. If humans – and their landscapes 
of concrete and glass, and their industrial sprawl – are kept within the confines of a megacity, 
the rest of the planet should be free to rewild, to revert to a more natural state.<br><br>

There’s one major problem with this. Cities do not exist as islands in isolation. They consume 
food from vast tracts of farmland, timber from the forests, minerals scraped from the Earth, water
that drains rivers, fish from the oceans, and energy which requires the plunder of yet more land. 
Depending on how resource hungry its citizens are, a city can use areas of land many factors larger 
than its own footprint. Robert Krulwich at NPR makes a great comparison of how cities use land area. 
A megacity that housed the entire population of the world at a similar concentration to a dense city 
like Paris would occupy around 350,000 square kilometres, or three US states. But if these citizens 
lived side-by-side in ranch houses, they would require a further four planets-worth of land to satisfy 
their resource demands.<br><br>

It is also uncertain how permanent many new megacities are. As many countries develop, low-density 
suburban sprawl and the take-over of wilderness will march across the world at unprecedented pace. 
No one, after all, imagines living cheek-by-jowl in a slum as anything other than a temporary measure
en route to better things.<br><br>

Currently, urban areas cover around 2% of the planet’s land area, but by 2030, they could stretch to 
almost 10% of the world's land surface. That means losing some 1.2 million square kilometres of other 
landscapes to urban construction alone, many of them rich in biodiversity. The Amazon, for example, is 
currently experiencing Brazil’s most rapid rate of urbanisation and is already home to 25 million people.
